=========================

[Feed] is a module for [Omeka S] that provides a RSS feed to users from selected
pages and resources.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

This module requires the module [Common], that should be installed first.

The module uses an external library, so use the release zip to install it, or
use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Feed.zip] from the list of releases (the master does
not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `Feed`, go to the root of the module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```


Usage
-----

Simply fill the form to list the selected pages and resources in site settings,
and they will be available as a rss feed at "https://example.org/s/my-site/feed"
(or "https://example.org/feed" if you skip the main site).

You can add "rss" or "atom" at the end of the url to force one type: "https://example.org/s/my-site/feed/atom".
Note: atom is currently not working with diacritics and other html entities.

Options available in the site settings are:
- Media type, that can be the standard one or the generic xml one.
- Content disposition, that can be Attachment, Inline, or Undefined.


TODO
----

- [ ] Implement inline link to feed inside html, like coins.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitLab.
