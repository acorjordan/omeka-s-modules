[Dynamic Item Sets] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to attach
automatically items to item sets via a standard query..

For example, it is possible to create an item set bringing together all the
items with blue color, or all items with type Audio or all items of the 14th
century, or any other query adapted to your item sets.

Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The module [Common] should be installed first.

* From the zip

Download the last release [DynamicItemSets.zip] from the list of releases and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `DynamicItemSets`.


Usage
-----

To make an item set dynamic, simply define the query that will define its items
via the field in the Advanced tab of item set edition.

When a query is set in the tab Advanced of the item set form, all existing and
new items will be automatically attached to this item set, according to the
request.

Warning: items that are manually attached to the item set will be automatically
detached if they are not in the results of the request.

There is no difference between dynamic item sets and others. So, it is
recommended to use a specific resource model or to add a property with a boolean
(module [Data Type Rdf]) to identify and to use them more easily.

Dynamic item sets can be identified via the advanced search with the "Is dynamic"
radio button or by adding `is_dynamic=1` in the url (https://example.org/admin/item-set?is_dynamic=1)
or exclude them with `is_dynamic=0`.


TODO
----

- [ ] Add a column in item sets browse.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------
