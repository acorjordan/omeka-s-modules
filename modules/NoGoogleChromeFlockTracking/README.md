No Google Chrome Flock Tracking (module for Omeka S)
====================================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[No Google Chrome Flock Tracking] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds a HTTP
header to invite Google not to track visitors via the browser Chrome. Indeed,
with the new versions of Chrome and derivative browsers, Google steals directly
your browsing history even if you forbid it, creates a profile, and gives access
to it to any other tracking tool via a unique flock identifier.

Of course, this tracking is currently illegal in most of the countries, whatever
Google says, but now this header is required to invite Google to respect the law
(there will be a small fine in some years). More information to [clean up the web]
or [in French].

You can check your current browser on [amifloced.org].

This module can be used in conjunction with the module [EU Cookie Bar], that
warns about the tracking by cookies when Google analytics or Facebook buttons
are used to steal data of your visitors.

This module is useless if you can access to the config of your server or if you
can add this in the Apache file ".htaccess" at the root of Omeka:

```.htaccess
Header always set Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()
```

This module simply adds these lines automatically if not present, after some
checks. Once installed, the module can be removed. Of course, it is better to
include the line above in the main config files of Apache.

Important: The Apache module "headers" must be enabled first:

```sh
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Nginx and other servers are currently not supported. You can find details of
config for them [here].

Note that the header must be added to any response, not only to the Omeka ones:
if the assets (images, js, css…) are not protected, Google will add (or maybe
not) the site in the visitor profile anyway.
