# Resource Meta

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for adding `<meta>` tags to resources.

With this module, administrators can map resource properties to
[metadata elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta).
This is helpful for web indexing and search engine optimization (SEO), making your
public resources more richly described and discoverable.

Here are a few resources that may help you map your properties for bibliographic
purposes:

- [Metadata tags for academic publications](http://div.div1.com.au/div-thoughts/div-commentaries/66-div-commentary-metadata)
- [Google Scholar: Inclusion Guidelines for Webmasters](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing)
